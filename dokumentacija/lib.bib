  abstract   = {Keystroke dynamics can valuably contribute to the development of intelligent authentication systems by enabling a single and continuous authentication process in a passive and non-intrusive manner by continuously verifying a user's identity. This work describes the KeyRecs dataset, which contains fixed-text and free-text samples of user typing behavior and demographic information of the participants age, gender, handedness, and nationality. The keystroke data was obtained from 99 participants of various nationalities who completed password retype and transcription exercises. The recorded samples consist of inter-key latencies computed in a digraph fashion measuring the time between each key press and release during an exercise. KeyRecs can be leveraged to improve the recognition of authorized users and prevent unauthorized access in biometric authentication software.},

The publicly available dataset of keystrokes was used, and the models with different parameters were trained using this data. Various neural network layers—convolutional, recurrent, and dense—in different configurations were employed together with pooling and dropout layers. The results were compared with the state-of-the-art model using the same dataset. The results varied, with the best-achieved accuracy equal to 82\% for the identification (1 of 20) task.},

  abstract  = {Decades before the Internet, ham radio provided instantaneous, global, person-to-person communication. Hundreds of thousands of amateur radio operators -- a predominantly male, middle- and upper-class group known as "hams" -- built and operated two-way radios for recreation in mid twentieth century America. In Ham Radio's Technical Culture, Kristen Haring examines why so many men adopted the technical hobby of ham radio from the 1930s through 1970s and how the pastime helped them form identity and community. Ham radio required solitary tinkering with sophisticated electronics equipment, often isolated from domestic activities in a "radio shack," yet the hobby thrived on fraternal interaction. Conversations on the air grew into friendships, and hams gathered in clubs or met informally for "eyeball contacts." Within this community, hobbyists developed distinct values and practices with regard to radio, creating a particular "technical culture." Outsiders viewed amateur radio operators with a mixture of awe and suspicion, impressed by hams' mastery of powerful technology but uneasy about their contact with foreigners, especially during periods of political tension. Drawing on a wealth of personal accounts found in radio magazines and newsletters and from technical manuals, trade journals, and government documents, Haring describes how ham radio culture rippled through hobbyists' lives. She explains why hi-tech employers recruited hams and why electronics manufacturers catered to these specialty customers. She discusses hams' position within the military and civil defense during World War II and the Cold War as well as the effect of the hobby on family dynamics. By considering ham radio in the context of other technical hobbies -- model building, photography, high-fidelity audio, and similar leisure pursuits -- Haring highlights the shared experiences of technical hobbyists. She shows that tinkerers influenced attitudes toward technology beyond hobby communities, enriching the general technical culture by posing a vital counterpoint.},

  abstract  = {Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) and pattern drawing have been used as common authentication methods especially on smartphones. Such methods, however, are very vulnerable to the shoulder surfing attack. Thus, keystroke dynamics that authenticate legitimate users based on their typing manner have been studied for years. However, many of the studies have focused on PC keyboard keystrokes. More studies on mobile and smartphones keystroke dynamics are warranted; as smartphones make progress in both hardware and software, features from smartphones have been diversified. In this paper, using various features including keystroke data such as time interval and motion data such as accelerometers and rotation values, we evaluate features with motion data and without motion data. We also compare 5 formulas for motion data, respectively. We also demonstrate that opposite gender match between a legitimate user and impostors has influence on authenticating by our experiment results.},

Keystroke dynamics can be used to analyze the way that a user types based on various keyboard input. Previous work has shown that user authentication and classification can be achieved based on keystroke dynamics. In this research, we consider the problem of user classification based on keystroke dynamics features collected from free-text. We implement and analyze a novel a deep learning model that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). We optimize the resulting model and consider several relevant related problems. Our model is competitive with the best results obtained in previous comparable research.},
